## â–º How To Play

The goal is simple, but the job is anything but.

1.  **Memorize the Order**: At the start of each round, the game will show you a sequence of ingredients by making the buttons "pop."
2.  **Repeat the Sequence**: Once the sequence is finished, it's your turn! Click the ingredient buttons in the exact same order.
3.  **Beat the Clock**: You must complete the order before the green timer bar at the top of the screen runs out.
4.  **Stay Focused**: One wrong ingredient and it's **Game Over!**
